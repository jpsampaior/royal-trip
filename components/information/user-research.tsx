            The user research conducted for Royal Trip was primarily based on
            insights gathered from various travel forums. These platforms
            provided a rich source of information, highlighting real-life
            challenges that travelers face when planning their trips. By
            analyzing discussions, it was possible to identify common pain
            points and desires that travelers have for an all-in-one solution.

            One of the most frequent issues mentioned by users on these forums
            was the overwhelming number of apps needed to organize a trip.
            Travelers expressed frustration with having to switch between apps
            for flights, hotels, restaurants, and local transportation. This
            feedback informed our decision to develop Royal Trip as a super app
            that consolidates all necessary travel services into a single
            platform.

            Another common topic of discussion was the lack of real-time updates
            regarding world events such as conflicts or natural disasters that
            could impact travel plans. Forum users emphasized the importance of
            having reliable information about regions to avoid, safety alerts,
            and changing immigration policies. This shaped our approach to
            integrating live updates and travel advisories directly within the
            app.

            Health concerns also surfaced frequently, particularly in relation
            to required vaccinations and other health restrictions for entering
            certain countries. Users expressed a need for a simple way to access
            this information without having to visit multiple government
            websites. This led us to include health advisory features, ensuring
            travelers are well-informed before departure.

            Additionally, many forum participants highlighted the
            unpredictability of local services due to conflicts or natural
            disasters. From transportation shutdowns to restricted access to
            popular tourist spots, users mentioned that these disruptions often
            caught them off guard. Royal Trip aims to mitigate these challenges
            by offering up-to-date service availability information within the
            app.

            Overall, the insights gained from these travel forums were
            invaluable in shaping the features of Royal Trip. By listening to
            the voices of real travelers, we were able to design a comprehensive
            app that addresses their most pressing concerns and simplifies the
            travel experience.
